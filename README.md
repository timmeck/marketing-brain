**Self-Learning Marketing Intelligence System for Claude Code**

Marketing Brain is an MCP server that gives Claude Code a persistent marketing memory. It tracks every post you publish, learns what works across platforms, and builds a Hebbian synapse network connecting posts, campaigns, strategies, templates, and insights. Over time, it learns your best-performing patterns and proactively suggests what to post, when, and where.

## Why Marketing Brain?

Without Marketing Brain, your marketing knowledge lives in your head. With it:

- **Posts are tracked** — Every post on X, Reddit, LinkedIn, Bluesky is stored with engagement metrics
- **Patterns emerge** — The learning engine finds your best posting times, formats, and platforms automatically
- **Strategies compound** — Successful strategies are recorded and suggested for similar future contexts
- **Rules are learned** — "Posts at 15:00 CET perform 2x better" — discovered and enforced automatically
- **Templates are extracted** — High-performing post structures become reusable templates
- **Gaps are detected** — "You never post on LinkedIn — potential?" — the research engine spots blind spots
- **Campaigns are connected** — Cross-promotion synergies between brands surface through the synapse network
- **Knowledge persists** — Every session builds on everything before it

## Features

### Core Intelligence
- **Post Tracking** — Store posts with platform, format, hashtags, URL, and full engagement history
- **Campaign Management** — Group posts into campaigns, track aggregate performance
- **Hebbian Synapse Network** — Weighted graph connecting posts, campaigns, strategies, templates, rules, audiences, and insights
- **Spreading Activation** — Explore related content by activating nodes in the network
- **Full-Text Search** — FTS5 indexes on posts, strategies, and templates

### Learning Engine (runs every 15 min)
- **Timing Patterns** — Discovers best/worst posting hours from engagement data
- **Format Patterns** — Finds which formats (text, image, video, thread) perform best
- **Platform Patterns** — Identifies your top-performing platform with Wilson Score confidence
- **Strategy Confidence** — Updates strategy scores based on real engagement
- **Rule Confidence** — Prunes low-confidence rules, promotes high-confidence ones
- **Similar Post Wiring** — Automatically connects similar posts in the synapse network

### Research Engine (runs every hour)
- **Trend Detection** — "Engagement on X is up 30% this week"
- **Gap Analysis** — "You haven't posted on LinkedIn yet — consider expanding"
- **Synergy Detection** — "Video + Monday = your best combo on Reddit"
- **Template Suggestions** — "Post #42 has high engagement — extract as template"
- **Optimization Ideas** — "Cross-post your top tweet as a LinkedIn article"

### Dashboard
- **HTML Dashboard** — Neural canvas background, glassmorphism UI, animated stats
- **Force-Directed Synapse Graph** — Interactive network visualization with drag, hover, tooltips
- **Platform Charts** — Color-coded distribution bars
- **Top Posts** — Engagement-scored post cards
- **Research Insights** — Tabbed view: Trends, Gaps, Synergies, Templates, Optimizations
- **Real-Time Updates** — SSE-powered live stats refresh every 30 seconds

### MCP Tools (17 tools for Claude Code)
- **Draft Checking** — Check a post against learned rules before publishing
- **Post Reporting** — Track published posts with one command
- **Engagement Updates** — Feed in likes, shares, impressions as they come
- **Strategy Memory** — Report what worked, get suggestions for what's next
- **Template Library** — Find and reuse high-performing post structures
- **Analytics** — Full dashboard data accessible from Claude Code

### Synapse Types

```
post → campaign        (belongs_to)
post → post            (similar_to)
post → audience        (engages_with)
strategy → post        (improves)
rule → post            (prevents / recommends)
template → post        (generated_from)
campaign → campaign    (cross_promotes)
insight → campaign     (informs)
```

## How It Learns

1. **Post Reported** — You publish a post and report it via CLI or MCP tool
2. **Engagement Tracked** — Likes, shares, impressions are updated over time
3. **Synapses Form** — Post ↔ Campaign, Post ↔ Post (similar), Strategy ↔ Post connections are created
4. **Patterns Extracted** — Learning engine finds timing, format, and platform patterns
5. **Rules Generated** — High-confidence patterns become rules with Wilson Score confidence
6. **Research Runs** — Trends, gaps, and synergies are surfaced as actionable insights
7. **Next Time** — When you draft a new post, Marketing Brain checks it against rules and suggests proven strategies

## Configuration

Configure via environment variables, CLI, or `~/.marketing-brain/config.json`:

```bash
# View current config
marketing config show

# Set a value
marketing config set learning.intervalMs 600000
marketing config set research.trendWindowDays 14

# Revert to default
marketing config delete learning.intervalMs
```

## Brain Ecosystem

Marketing Brain is part of the **Brain Ecosystem** — a family of standalone MCP servers that give Claude Code persistent, self-learning memory.

| Brain | Purpose | Ports |
|-------|---------|-------|
| [Brain](https://github.com/timmeck/brain) v2.2.0 | Error memory, code intelligence & persistent context | 7777 / 7778 |
| [Trading Brain](https://github.com/timmeck/trading-brain) | Adaptive trading intelligence | 7779 / 7780 |
| **Marketing Brain** | Content strategy & engagement | **7781** / 7782 / 7783 |
| [Brain Core](https://github.com/timmeck/brain-core) v1.6.0 | Shared infrastructure (IPC, MCP, REST, CLI, math, synapses, memory) | — |
| [Brain Hub](https://timmeck.github.io/brain-hub/) | Ecosystem landing page | — |

Each brain is **fully standalone** — [Brain Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@timmeck/brain-core) provides shared infrastructure (IPC, MCP, REST API, CLI, math, synapse algorithms) used by all brains, eliminating ~2,800 lines of duplicated code.

### Cross-Brain Communication

Brains discover and query each other at runtime via IPC named pipes. Use `marketing peers` to see online peers, or the `marketing_query_peer` / `marketing_ecosystem_status` MCP tools to access peer data from Claude Code. Use `marketing_cross_promote` to pull Brain insights as content ideas, or `marketing_trading_performance` to pull Trading Brain stats for performance posts. Brains also push event notifications — when Marketing Brain publishes a post or creates a campaign, peers are notified automatically.

### Ecosystem Dashboard

The interactive HTML dashboard (`marketing dashboard`) includes an Ecosystem Peers section showing the live status of all connected brains.
